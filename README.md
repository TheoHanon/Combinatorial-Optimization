the utils.jl file contains the preprocessing and plots functions, the model.jl file contains all our models,
the greedy.jl file contains evrything related to greedy algorithm and local search
the project.ipynb is the (Python) notebook contains all the results of out numerical experiments
the visualizer.ipynb (Julia) notebook contains a small code to visualize results with and without greedy initialization on a chosen instance
